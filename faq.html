        <p><b>Are pseudonyms allowed?</b></p>
        <p>For free form zine entries: yes absolutely. For journal entries: we request that authors publish under a “real” name but do not enforce this yet. </p>
        <p><b>What do I get for publishing in JORE?</b></p>
        <p>In the true spirit of academia, we only offer the prestige of publication as compensation. However, as a special offer for our first “real” issue, I’m willing to print out and mail a physical copy of JORE to your address, as long as that address is within the US. These are the only physical copies of JORE I’m planning on creating. </p>
        <p><b>Who can submit to JORE?</b></p>
        <p>Anyone can submit to JORE. Academics, former academics, aspiring academics, people who have rejected academia or failed to enter it–your experience is valid and we want to hear about it. Maybe this can be your first paper, or maybe it will be your hundredth. </p>
        <p><b>What is your submission process like?</b></p>
        <p>
            Submit your original work to our Google form. We will notify you if your work is selected for publication via email. We may contact you about edits or typesetting.
            What is your impact factor?
        </p>
        <p><b>What is your acceptance rate?</b></p>
        <p>Right now we actually have an acceptance rate of 100%. If you’re looking for something more prestigious I highly recommend JofUR. Realistically we accept almost anything that’s reasonably sane so send us whatever, if there’s too many of you we’ll stick you in the next issue or something. </p>
        <p><b>What is your current them/when do submissions close etc</b></p>
        <p>Check out the call for submissions page </p>
        <p><b>Do I have to stick to theme?</b></p>
        <p>No</p>
        <p><b>Is this peer reviewed?</b></p>
        <p>Your peers will review your submission. </p>
