        What is JORE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Journal Of Research Experiences is an experimental zine & journal 
        run by graduate students, for graduate students. We collect media about 
        all aspects of academia and  seek to be a truthful, useful, and 
        entertaining resource for aspiring academics, where researchers are 
        free to get into the nitty gritty and personal side of their work. 
        We accept formal articles, free form zine musings, poetry, and 
        standalone "figures".
      </p>
      <p>
        JORE is currently in its alpha testing phase. We’re thinking about doing 
        sporadic (~2 or 3 months) releases of our issues, each with a loose theme. 
      </p>
      <h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
      <p>
        Submission Deadline: June 1 (though we all know none of you have any 
        executive function and this is going to be extended to June 5). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Prospective authors are invited to submit low quality papers, standalone 
        figures, and content not limited to but including recaps, nonfiction poetry, 
        and rants to the July 2024 edition of JORE. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme this month is “Failed Experiments”. Practically every researcher 
        has experienced attempting an experiment that did not pan out, and was not 
        included in publication due to a lack of results. This is an opportunity to 
        expound on things you’ve tried that never made it to publication, whether 
        that be initial iterations not worthy of mention or a completely scrapped 
        project. Entertaining photos or early prototypes, if relevant, are encouraged, 
        as are dives into the background and planning around a project. “Failed 
        experiments” is a broad umbrella– maybe your lab or class tried something 
        new (lab lunch before the meeting) that resulted in unintended consequences. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, we also welcome off-theme submissions.
