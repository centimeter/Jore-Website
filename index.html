        What is JORE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ever lost your data? Ever made an experiment-dooming mistake? Ever make a fantastically incorrect assumption? We're collecting your experiences for JORE.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Journal Of Research Experiences is an experimental zine & grassroots journal 
        run by students. We collect media about all aspects of academia, particularly failures that don't get discussed or published. 
        We accept formal articles, free form zine musings, poetry, and 
        standalone "figures".
      </p>
      <p>
        JORE is currently in its alpha testing phase. We’re thinking about doing 
        sporadic (~2 or 3 months) releases of our issues, each with a loose theme. 
      </p>
      <h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
      <p>
        Submission Deadline: June 1 (though we all know none of you have any 
        executive function and this is going to be extended to June 5). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Prospective authors are invited to submit low quality papers, standalone 
        figures, and content not limited to but including recaps, nonfiction poetry, 
        and rants to the July 2024 edition of JORE. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The theme this month is “Bad Data”. Practically every researcher 
        has experienced attempting something that did not work out, and was not 
        included in publication due to a lack of results. This is an opportunity to 
        expound on things you’ve tried that never made it to publication, whether 
        that be initial iterations not worthy of mention or a completely scrapped 
        project. Entertaining photos or early prototypes, if relevant, are encouraged, 
        as are dives into the background and planning around a project. “Bad Data” 
        is a broad umbrella– maybe your lab or class tried something 
        new (moving lab lunch to before the meeting) that resulted in unintended consequences. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, we also welcome off-theme submissions. 
      </p>
